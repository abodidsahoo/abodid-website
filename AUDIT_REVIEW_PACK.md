| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin / Curator** | `Abodid Samaday@gmail.com` | `123` |

## 5. Specific Audit Requests

1.  **Codebase Cleanliness**: Check for any redundant files or poor architectural decisions in `src/`.
2.  **Security**: Verify that RLS (Row Level Security) policies on Supabase are correctly implemented for the `page_metadata` and `resources` tables.
3.  **Performance**: Review the `AudioScrollVolume` and `CardStacker` components for potential memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.
4.  **SEO**: Verify the dynamic Open Graph image generation implementation in `src/lib/og-helper.tsx`.
